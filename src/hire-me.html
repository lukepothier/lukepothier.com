        <h1>Hire me!</h1>

        <p>
            I am a pragmatic, thorough, and hard-working software engineer with six years' experience building enterprise software. My primary competency is .NET, but I have plenty of experience with several tech stacks. I also have experience managing software teams.
            I am a fast learner, and I am willing and able to transition to other tech stacks efficiently. I live in Cape Town, South Africa (UTC+02:00), and I'm primarily looking for remote work for US- or EU-based companies. I am a dual citizen of South
            Africa and Ireland, so I'm equipped to travel and work internationally fairly easily.
        </p>

        <p>I am passionate about high-quality software. I am looking for full-time remote work that is back-end, front-end web, or Android-based. I am open to roles that include elements of management, although I am a programmer primarily.
        </p>
